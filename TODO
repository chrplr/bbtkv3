- add tests, for the parsing of events and conversion to csv.
- robustify the case when a sensor starts or ends  'up' (ie. at 1). This crashes detect_edges()
- implement adjustable thresholds in cmd/bbtk, reading the thresholds form the command line or from a configuration file 	
- create cmd/ibbtk, an interactive version with commands (check stuff/)
