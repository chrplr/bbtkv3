- add posibility to start capture by pressing a key
- add posibility to wait for a certain amount of time before starting capture
- add tests, for the parsing of events and conversion to csv.
- robustify the case when a sensor starts or ends  'up' (ie. at 1). This crashes detect_edges()
- create cmd/ibbtk, an interactive version with commands (check stuff/)
