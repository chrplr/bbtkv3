- improves the naming scheme of event files.
- add commands to set thresholds and to set smoothing
- refactor & add tests for event.go
- robustify the case when a sensor starts or ends  'up' (ie. at 1). This crashes detect_edges()
- (maybe) add posibility to start capture by pressing a key
- create cmd/ibbtk, an interactive version with commands (check stuff/)
