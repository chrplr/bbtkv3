Control a Black Box ToolKit 
===========================

The program drives a [Black Box Toolkit BBTKv3](https://www.blackboxtoolkit.com/bbtkv3.html) to capture events.

The executables for various operating systems/architectures are in the `binaries` folder

To get the usage, type:

    bbtk-capture -h


This is a *Work In Progress*. The program is running but still needs helper functions to parse the output of the BBTK.
